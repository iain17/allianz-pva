# Plan van Aanpak: Thesis Allianz Blockchain

This document was written as part of my bachelor's thesis at the Hogeschool Arnhem Nijmegen. I was asked to write this in the Dutch language and several changes were made to match the style of my University.
It has been written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) using the Cambridge LaTeX [thesis template](https://github.com/cambridge/thesis) for PhD students.

## What now?
Well. You can use this repository as a basis to build your own document if you are in a similar position: graduating and are looking for a example of how such a document could be written in LaTeX.
Mind you, this was my first LaTeX document and it wasn't the last.
